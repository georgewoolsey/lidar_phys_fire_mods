# Tree Biomass Process{#s05}

In this section we'll use the benchmark data made available in the [`NeonTreeEvaluation`](https://github.com/weecology/NeonTreeEvaluation_package) data set ([Weinstein et al. 2021](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4986448711981898434&hl=en&as_sdt=0,6)) to test a process for estimating biomass in kg at the tree level. The ultimate goal is to incorporate this process in the [`cloud2trees`](https://github.com/georgewoolsey/cloud2trees) package (Woolsey and Tinkham, 2024).

We will test out three methods for attaching biomass in kg to a spatial tree list:

1. Estimate single tree biomass (kg) using allometric equations based on predictors such as tree diameter, height, and species
    + This methodology is well represented in the literature with allometries developed for nearly all tree species ([Chojnacky et al. 2014](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13769102016905655949&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5); [Ter-Mikaelian & Korzukhin 1997](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6148302766104288498&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5))
    + [Gonzalez‐Akre et al. (2022)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14167690887599848846&oi=gsb&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) developed an R package to perform this exact task: [`allodb`](https://github.com/ropensci/allodb).
2. Use models developed to predict canopy fuel stratum at the stand level based on common stand descriptors (e.g. TPH and  basal area) and distribute the stand-level estimate (in kg per m^2^ or kg per m^3^) across the individual trees in the stand
    + [Cruz et al. (2003)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=316241498622221569&oi=gsb&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) developed models to predict canopy fuel stratum at the stand level for four coniferous forest types common in the western US: Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and mixed conifer.
    + Models for other forests types are currently lacking which limits the scope of this methodology
3. Use raster estimates of canopy fuel stratum such as the [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/fuel) database developed jointly by the USDA Forest Service and USDOI Office of Wildland Fire (OWF) and distribute the fuel estimate across the individual trees that fall in a raster cell
    + There is an R package for accessing the LANDFIRE data [`rlandfire`](https://github.com/bcknr/rlandfire)

## Preliminaries

Like [Cruz et al. (2003)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=316241498622221569&oi=gsb&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5), we'll use the term "crown" to describe aerial fuels at the tree level and the term "canopy" at the stand level.

Below, we provide an overview of some commonly used fuel complex characteristics: canopy fuel load (CFL) and canopy bulk density (CBD). In simple terms, imagine a box filled with leaves, fuel load represents the total weight of all the leaves in the box while bulk density represents how tightly those leaves are packed within the box.

**Canopy Fuel Load**

* Definition: The total amount of flammable material (like leaves, needles, branches) within the tree crowns in a given area.
* Focus: Primarily on the mass of the fuel.
* Units: Typically expressed in units of mass per unit area (e.g., kilograms per square meter, tons per acre).
* Scope: Fuel load focuses on the overall amount of fuel.
* Significance: Important for understanding the overall fire potential of an area. A higher fuel load generally means more potential fuel for a fire to consume.

**Canopy Bulk Density**

* Definition: The mass of flammable material per unit volume of the tree crown.
* Focus: Considers both the mass of fuel and the space it occupies.
* Units: Typically expressed in units of mass per unit volume (e.g., kilograms per cubic meter).
* Scope: Bulk density considers how the fuel load is distributed within the tree crown.
* Significance: Crucial for predicting how easily a fire can spread through the tree crowns. Higher bulk density can increase the likelihood of crown fires.

## Example Lidar Data

Let's load an example lidar dataset from Weinstein et al. ([2021](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4986448711981898434&hl=en&as_sdt=0,6)) in their `NeonTreeEvaluation` package.

We'll use data from a NEON site that we know has conifers: RMNP (Rocky Mountain National Park)

```{r}
# get the laz file path
las_f_path_temp <- system.file(package = "NeonTreeEvaluation", "extdata") %>% 
    list.files(recursive = T, pattern = ".*\\.(laz|las)$", full.names = T) %>% 
    unique() %>% 
    dplyr::as_tibble() %>%
    dplyr::rename(f_path = 1) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(
      stringr::str_detect(f_path,  "RMNP")
    ) %>% 
    dplyr::slice(15) %>% 
    dplyr::pull(f_path)
```

check the data

```{r}
# check the data
lidR::readLAS(las_f_path_temp) %>% 
  lidR::plot(
    color = "Z", breaks = "quantile", bg = "white", legend = T
   , pal = harrypotter::hp(n=50, house = "gryffindor")
  )
```

### `cloud2trees` that lidar data

extract trees from the lidar data using `cloud2trees`

we will estimate DBH, CBH, and forest type for this data

```{r, message=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# save our output_dir
od <- tempdir()
# cloud2trees
cloud2trees_ans <- cloud2trees::cloud2trees(
  input_las_dir = las_f_path_temp
  , output_dir = od
  , keep_intrmdt = T
  , estimate_tree_dbh = T
  , estimate_tree_type = T
  , estimate_tree_cbh = T, cbh_estimate_missing_cbh = T, cbh_tree_sample_n = 55
)
```

let's see what we got

```{r}
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf %>% dplyr::glimpse()
```

where is this?

```{r}
# where?
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf %>% 
  mapview::mapview(layer.name = "trees")
```

*zoom out if you can't see anything*

what does our CBH data look like?

```{r}
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tree_height_m, y = tree_cbh_m, color = is_training_cbh)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "height (m)", y = "CBH (m)", color = "is CBH\nfrom cloud") +
  theme_light()
  
```

what does our DBH data look like?

```{r}
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tree_height_m, y = dbh_cm)) +
  geom_point(color = "navy") +
  labs(x = "height (m)", y = "DBH (cm)") +
  theme_light()
  
```

how about the forest type?

```{r}
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf %>% 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  dplyr::count(forest_type_group)
```

## Method 1: single tree biomass (kg) using allometric equations

The first method we'll explore for attaching biomass in kg to a spatial tree list is estimating single tree biomass (kg) using allometric equations based on predictors such as tree diameter, height, and species.

This methodology is well represented in the literature with allometries developed for nearly all tree species ([Chojnacky et al. 2014](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13769102016905655949&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5); [Ter-Mikaelian & Korzukhin 1997](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6148302766104288498&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)). [Gonzalez‐Akre et al. (2022)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14167690887599848846&oi=gsb&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5) developed an R package to perform this exact task: [`allodb`](https://github.com/ropensci/allodb).

### Define species based on forest type group

`cloud2trees` gives us USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) forest type group codes when we set the parameter `estimate_tree_type = T`. However, the `allodb` package requires genus and species information to estimate tree biomass. We need to make or find a lookup table to map the FIA forest type group to the genus and species.

Alternatively, we can use the `allodb::new_equations()` function to modify the set of equations that will be used to estimate the biomass

#### Manual

we can manually set the genus and species to PICO

```{r}
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf$biomass_kg <- allodb::get_biomass(
  dbh = cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf$dbh_cm
  , genus = rep("Pinus", times = nrow(cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf))
  , species = rep("contorta", times = nrow(cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf))
  , coords = 
    c(-105.53886, 40.16380)
    # cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf %>% 
    #   sf::st_transform(crs = sf::st_crs(4326)) %>% 
    #   sf::st_coordinates()
)
```

what did we get back?

```{r}
cloud2trees_ans$treetops_sf$biomass_kg %>% 
  summary()
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
remove(list = ls()[grep("_temp",ls())])
remove(list = ls())
gc()
```
